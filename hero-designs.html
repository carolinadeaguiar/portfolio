<section class="section" aria-labelledby="the-context">

    <div class="content-block">
      <h2 id="the-context">Why Hero Surfaces Matter</h2>
      <p>Hero surfaces are often the first experience customers have with a product. Many arrive via search or advertising, so the hero must instantly communicate trust, clarity, and relevance. Design must guide the eye, deliver the offer, and maintain brand integrity without creating visual noise.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>First impressions shape customer trust.</li>
        <li>Hero areas carry commercial pressure and attract stakeholder attention.</li>
        <li>Effective heroes communicate value clearly; poor ones confuse users.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Designing these heroes meant leading the team to ensure every surface immediately built trust, reinforced the brand, and supported the start of the customer journey.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visual hierarchy over decoration</strong> – every element must earn its space.</li>
        <li><strong>Brand expression supports clarity</strong> – boldness is valuable only if it doesn’t confuse users.</li>
        <li><strong>Data informs, craft decides</strong> – insights guide decisions, but aesthetics and hierarchy shape the first impression.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frequent reviews:</strong> iterative feedback sessions ensured the team moved quickly without uncertainty.</li>
