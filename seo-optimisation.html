            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Storefront and content pages had built up years of <strong>SEO and performance debt</strong> — slow load times, inconsistent markup, poor indexation, and brittle CMS patterns. Publishing new pages was slow, risky, and prone to regression.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="three-col__item">
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Led a full storefront and content redesign with SEO, performance, and accessibility treated as first-class design constraints. Delivered a modular, CMS-ready system with semantic structure, performance budgets, and SEO rules enforced by default.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="three-col__item">
            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p><strong>Lighthouse score improved from 83 to 95</strong>, <strong>indexed pages increased by ~10%</strong>, <strong>organic traffic rose ~15% within three months</strong>. A tested component drove <strong>+2.69% step conversion</strong>, and content publishing is now faster and far less error-prone, letting teams ship confidently at scale.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Existing pages were slow, inconsistent, and hard to scale without breaking SEO or performance.</li>
        <li>Designers and CMS editors had too much freedom and too little guidance, leading to fragile pages and repeated regressions.</li>

        <li>Worked in close partnership with engineering through build, QA and release, with design accountable for performance and SEO outcomes — not just visual sign-off.</li>

      <h2 id="design-decisions">Key Design Decisions</h2>
      <p>The decisions below focus on removing SEO risk at scale, improving performance where it materially affected users, and enabling teams to ship confidently without repeated rework.</p>
      
      <!-- Decision #1 -->
      <h3>Decision #1: Build a modular, SEO-safe design system</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Ad-hoc page layouts created inconsistent markup, poor indexation, and recurring regressions. A modular system ensured semantic structure, accessibility, and SEO rules were enforced by default.</li>
        <li><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Higher upfront design and documentation effort in exchange for long-term scalability and reduced maintenance cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Faster page creation, fewer publishing errors, and a reusable foundation that supported consistent indexation and performance across storefront and content pages.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <!-- Decision #2 -->
      <h3>Decision #2: Prioritise performance over visual complexity</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Page speed and Core Web Vitals directly impact crawlability, rankings, and user trust—particularly on mobile. Performance was treated as a design constraint, not a technical afterthought.</li>
        <li><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Reduced decorative elements and heavyweight assets, while preserving high-performing components such as promotional hero signalling.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Lighthouse performance improved from 83 → 95, faster mobile load times, and clearer signals to both users and search engines without compromising brand or compliance requirements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="process-title">Process Snapshots</h2>
      <p>These snapshots show how real constraints — SEO rules, performance budgets, CMS limitations and delivery pressure — shaped the work. The focus was on building a system that performed reliably in real-world conditions — across seasonal changes, promotional states and compliance requirements — rather than optimising individual pages in isolation.</p>
