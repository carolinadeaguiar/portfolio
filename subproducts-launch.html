      <p>Strategic decisions balanced the available timeframe with a clear understanding of the non-negotiables from day one.</p>
      <p>These decisions shaped both what shipped and what was deliberately left out.</p>
      
      <!-- Decision #1 -->
      <h3>Decision #1: Protect scope by prioritising non-negotiables</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Tight timelines required clear boundaries to avoid last-minute compromises.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Both sub-products launched without critical gaps or rework.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <!-- Decision #2 -->
      <h3>Decision #2: Guided team on constraint-driven design</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Help designers focus energy on what matters most.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Team learned to work efficiently, improving future delivery cycles.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>One deliberate decision was to delay promotional logic until after launch, protecting clarity and delivery confidence under time pressure.</p>

      <p>This work demonstrated how a design team can work under constraints while gaining confidence, and how a clear process creates a reusable framework for the future.</p>
      
      <!-- Quant Results -->
      <h3>Quantitative Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Two sub-products launched on time and within budget, demonstrating that clear prioritisation and constraint-led decision-making can enable speed without increasing delivery risk or team burnout.</p> 
      
      <!-- Qual Outcomes -->
      <h3>Qualitative Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A reusable framework that reduced future launch effort and set a precedent for how new products are introduced within the portfolio.</li>
            <li>The team gained confidence in working under constraints.</li>
            <li>Prioritisation principles established for future projects.</li>
            <li>Smoother alignment between stakeholders and the design team.</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>The framework has since been referenced for subsequent product initiatives, reducing uncertainty around future launches.</p>
