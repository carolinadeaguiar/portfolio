      <p>Strategic decisions balanced speed of iteration, user clarity, and measurable outcomes:</p>
      
      <!-- Decision #1 -->
      <h3>Decision #1: Logical grouping (iteration 1)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Rationale: Customers were dropping off at cover level selection, indicating decision uncertainty. Logical grouping was tested to reduce cognitive load and improve comprehension.</li>
        <li>Trade-offs: Minor design deviation to measure lift without full redesign.</li>
        <li>Outcome: The variant delivered a <strong>relative +4.13% CTR uplift vs control</strong>. Post-test analysis showed continued confusion around price presentation, which informed the hypothesis for the next iteration.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <!-- Decision #2 -->
      <h3>Decision #2: Price transparency (iteration 2)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Rationale: Learnings from iteration 1 revealed price comprehension as the primary remaining blocker. This iteration tested clearer price proximity and presentation.</li>
        <li>Trade-offs: Known friction remained within the personal cover subcategory to isolate the impact of price proximity on cover type selection.</li>
        <li>Outcome: Outside of the promotional periods, clearer price presentation delivered a <strong>relative +5.33% CTR uplift</strong>. Results indicated that discount visibility during promotions required further optimisation.</li>

      <figcaption>
        <strong>Pre-test data landscape:</strong> The control experience presented four cover options as separate list items, resulting in an average 26% in-page drop-off and an NPS of 68 among new joiners. Session replays and heuristic review revealed decision friction: customers repeatedly scrolled between cover options and the fixed-price basket to understand value. While heatmaps suggested healthy engagement in isolation, triangulating qualitative and quantitative signals exposed a clear optimisation opportunity.

Outside of promotions, clearer price transparency delivered a relative +5.33% CTR uplift at the Options step, supported by a +5.06% conversion rate and +1.33% ATV uplift (97% statistical significance). Promotional periods showed temporary volatility, informing the decision to roll out while isolating promo behaviour for further optimisation.

        <strong>Average Transaction Value (ATV) in context:</strong> During testing, ATV decreased as more customers selected the lowest-priced cover. However, analysis of purchases outside the test window showed this to be a consistent baseline behaviour. External data from the UK Department for Transport further supported this pattern, suggesting the experiment improved clarity rather than distorting purchasing intent—aligning outcomes with Consumer Duty principles.

<!-- 06.1 Metrics used for decision making -->
<section class="section" aria-labelledby="metrics">

    <div class="content-block">
      <h2 id="metrics">Metrics Used for Decision-Making</h2>
      <p>
        The experiments were evaluated using a small set of shared metrics agreed with
        analytics and engineering. Each metric served a specific purpose in understanding user behaviour, managing commercial risk, and ensuring decisions were made at sufficient statistical confidence
      </p>

      <h3>Primary metric — Click-Through Rate (CTR)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Measured progression at the cover type selection step, acting as the primary signal of decision clarity at a critical mid-funnel moment.</li>
        <li>Chosen to isolate user intent while reducing noise from downstream variables such as payment behaviour, promotions, and traffic mix.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Supporting metrics — Funnel and revenue health</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conversion Rate (CR):</strong> Monitored to ensure improvements in CTR did not negatively affect completed purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>Average Transaction Value (ATV):</strong> Observed directionally to understand whether changes in price presentation influenced purchase value.</li>
        <li><strong>Revenue Per Visitor (RPV):</strong> Used as a commercial sense-check to validate that improved funnel progression aligned with overall revenue performance.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Statistical confidence and decision thresholds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Set a minimum statistical confidence threshold (≥90%) before acting on any results; tests ran until this threshold was reached within the planned test window.</li>
        <li>Acted on results only after sufficient traffic volume reduced false positives and seasonal bias.</li>
        <li>Where confidence was not met, variants were treated as learnings rather than wins and informed subsequent hypotheses instead of being shipped.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
      <p>This work demonstrated how iterative, low-risk experimentation could meaningfully improve funnel progression while building confidence in data-informed design decisions across the team.</p>
      
      <!-- Primary Results -->
      <h3>Primary Results (Experiment Metrics)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Relative +4.1% to +5.3% CTR uplift vs control</strong></li>
        <li>Results were statistically significant (≥97%) across two iterations</li>
    </ul>
      
      <!-- Secondary Indicators -->
      <h3>Secondary Indicators (Observed Effects)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Conversion rate uplift observed post-click, confirming downstream funnel health.</li>
            <li>ATV and RPV were monitored as commercial guardrails rather than primary optimisation targets, ensuring improvements in decision clarity did not introduce misaligned or pressured purchasing behaviour.
            </li>
        </ul>

      
      <!-- Qualitative Outcomes -->
      <h3>Qualitative Outcomes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved alignment between design, engineering, and analytics</li>
        <li>Faster decision-making through shared experiment readouts</li>
        <li>Shift towards hypothesis-led optimisation in funnel design</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Iterative testing allows fast validation without large redesigns.</li>
            <li>Early assumptions can be invalidated; testing is critical.</li>
            <li>Continuous measurement ensures learnings are actionable.</li>
            <li>Optimisation requires balancing funnel efficiency with customer clarity, not maximising a single metric in isolation.</li>

      <!-- Leadership -->
      <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Coordinated product, engineering, analytics, and design to enable rapid, low-risk experimentation with shared ownership of outcomes.</li>
            <li>Documented experiment rationale, results, and learnings to create a reusable knowledge base for future CRO initiatives.</li>
            <li>Used data and experimentation learnings to influence decisions around commercial guardrails, recognising when further iteration on ATV would add complexity without materially improving customer outcomes.</li>
            <li>Used this case study to mentor junior designers on hypothesis-driven experimentation, ethical optimisation, and balancing commercial goals with Consumer Duty responsibilities.</li>
